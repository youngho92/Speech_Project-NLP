# US Presidential Speeches Project

This project is analyze US presidential speeches using sentimental analysis and clusters. I used 968 speeches of the 43 US presidents and vectorized their speeches based on the word frequency. I used TextBlob, Gensim, Sklearn to conduct sentimental analysis and discover clusters among presidents based on normalized 2-dimentional PCA results.
